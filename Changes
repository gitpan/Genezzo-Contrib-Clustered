Revision history for Perl extension Genezzo::Contrib::Clustered.
0.43  Mon Oct 01 01:00:00 2007
	Move Genezzo/Contrib/Clustered/Clustered.pm up one level.
	Fix Genezzo-Contrib-Clustered.t by adding removal of trailing semi in SQL.

0.33  Wed Jan 18 23:00:00 2006
	Revised POD in ModPerlWrap.  Requires Apache 2.  Signal handling
	  problem on Mac OS X is due to Apache 1.3.

0.32  Mon Jan 16 23:00:00 2006
	Revised SIGUSR2 handling in GLockUR and ModPerlWrap.
	OS X 10.3.9 kill SIGUSR2 handling is sometimes delayed till 
	  next request (WHY?).

0.31  Sun Jan 15 01:00:00 2006
	POD doc fixes.

0.30  Sat Jan 14 23:00:00 2006
	Added new locking module GLockUR, based on Unix Record locking.
	Works on OS X, EXCEPT processes exit immediately after 
	  signal handlers are run (why?)
	Also on OS X need to add to httpd.conf
	  PerlHeaderParserHandler "sub { tie *STDOUT, 'Apache' unless tied *STDOUT; }"

0.29  Tue Jan 10 20:30:00 2006
	Fix race condition in ModPerlWrap.

0.28  Tue Jan 03 23:30:00 2006
	Modify ModPerlWrap to run better when preloaded with PerlModule.
	Added use test case for ModPerlWrap.

0.27  Tue Jan 03 09:00:00 2006
	Modify ModPerlWrap to reset $processing and $restart on each
	  PageStart()

0.26  Mon Jan 02 23:00:00 2006
	Modified VerifyChecksum and UpdateChecksum to use new
	  Genezzo::Block::Util routines.

0.25  Sun Jan 01 17:00:00 2006
	Added ModPerlWrap.pm and sample genezzo_form.pl to use Apache
	  web server as multi-user XML over HTTP interface to 
	  Clustered Genezzo.
	Added support for asyncronous notification of blocking lock
	  requests.  See ModPerlWrap or modified genloopclient.pl for
	  examples.

0.24  Sat Dec 24 01:00:00 2005
	Modified DLM code to raise DEADLOCK error on deadlock.
	Added experimental Kngz_Execute hook to catch DEADLOCK.
	Modified DLM code to support demoteAll (to SH) besides unlockAll.
	Commit now uses demoteAll insead of unlockAll, to match current
	  buffer cache behavior.
	Added DLM function ast_poll to determine whether there are any
	  recent requests for locks held by that process.
	Added new client genloopclient.pl to test locking interactions between 
	  clients. 
	Now recommend rollback as first action in gendba or scripts,
	  so all blocks will be locked.

0.23  Fri Dec 23 12:00:00 2005
	Modify ReadBlock to replace instead of wrap _filereadblock
	  to avoid duplicate reads.
	Attempted moving DirtyBlock to BufCaElt::_dirty; doesn't work
	  so left old DirtyScalar::STORE method registered.
	sync is no longer called on non-Cygwin Win32.  autoflush(1) is
	  called instead.  Yes, this probably gives terrible performance,
	  but it should pass CPAN Testers :-)

0.22  Tue Dec 20 11:00:00 2005
	HTML doc fix.

0.21  Mon Dec 19 23:00:00 2005

0.18  Sun Oct 23 19:00:00 2005

0.17  Tue Aug 30 11:59:00 2005
        modified PrepUndo to use DictSetFileInfo to add undo_filename
	  to default.dbf file header
