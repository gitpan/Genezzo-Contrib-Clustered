Genezzo-Contrib-Clustered 
=========================

Shared data cluster support for Genezzo

Genezzo is an extensible database with SQL and DBI.  It is written in Perl.
Basic routines inside Genezzo are overridden via Havok SysHooks.  Override
routines provide support for shared data clusters.  Routines
provide transactions, distributed locking, undo, and recovery.
