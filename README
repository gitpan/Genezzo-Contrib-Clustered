Genezzo-Contrib-Clustered 
=========================

Shared data cluster support for Genezzo

Genezzo is an extensible database with SQL and DBI.  It is written in Perl.
Basic routines inside Genezzo are overridden via Havok SysHooks.  Override
routines will (eventually) provide support for shared data clusters.  Routines
will provide transactions, distributed locking, undo, and recovery.  Today
these routines support a single-user single-threaded database, and provide
basic transactional commit and rollback via undo.  Locking routines are
currently stubs.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

To prepare for use of Genezzo::Clustered

  ./genprepundo.pl

  gendba.pl
  >@havok.sql
  >@syshook.sql
  >@clustered.sql

LIMITATIONS

  No Distributed/clustered functionality today.  Still single machine, 
  single process, single user, single threaded.

  This is pre-alpha software; don't use it to store any data you hope
  to see again!

  While OpenDLM locking is now working, undo is still single process
  (all processes use undo processid 1, so state and undo is overwritten).

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Genezzo
